		<p>
			Body text weight is a little light for legibility
			<br> 
			Make it heavier,
			<br>
			Text can be a little larger also 
			<br>
			Great images!
			<br>
			Consider doing black text on a white background or light 
			<br>
			background it may be easier to read
			<br>
			Hierarchy of numbers: make them bold maybe
			<br>
			Consider making this a scroll by just having these come one after another
			<br>
