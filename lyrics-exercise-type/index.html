				Taking your love away<br>
				And if you have to go it's okay<br>
				Just remember happier times<br>
				And when you leave here<br>
				Just say goodbye<br>

				<div class="emphasis">They're all obsessed<br>
				With having the best<br>
				Never take a rest<br>
				And treasure their breath<br>
				We get obsessed<br>
				With being the best<br>
				Just take your time<br>
				And treasure this life<br>
				(treasure this life)<br></div>

				Try to be concerned with things that you got<br>
				Don't be concerned 'bout the next one spot<br>
				Like who's out and who's not, you know<br>
				Bridges get burned, lessons get learned<br>
				We try to fix things, you got problems like<br>
				Be prepared to pass the test later on
				But that's later on<br>
				For now we go-<div class="emphasis">ohhhh ohhhh ohhh ohh<br></div>

				Oh, I can't tell you what we doing<br>
				But I know one thing (Oooh uh)<br>
				Oh, I was going insane, could hardly take the pain<br>
				Hard to manage my brain<br>
				Needed a change (Oooh uh)<br>
