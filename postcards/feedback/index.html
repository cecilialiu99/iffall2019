		<li>
		<p>I think the choice to make the images black and white is stategic and fitting for the theme. 
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
		The font choice for the first image is the most successful as it is well integrated into the image and fits the context
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
		All of the images are placed in a way that allows room for the text to be place and is legible. 
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
		I think it would be interesting to experiments with different ways to place the type on the image, playing with space and scale a bit more- maybe emphasizing certain words. 
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
		There is opportunity to experiment with more type faces as well.
		</li>
		<li>
		In this case, the images that are more successful are the ones that do not feature the black box on the side (like in the second image)
		</li>

		<li>
		Maybe make the names of the person smaller than the quote itself to create hierarchy?
